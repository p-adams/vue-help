Maccherone, Jr.\n\n_A drop-in substitute for the browser native localStorage API that runs on node.js._\n\n### Working ###\n\n* All methods in the [localStorage spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#storage) \n  interface including:\n  * length\n  * setItem(key, value)\n  * getItem(key)\n  * removeItem(key)\n  * key(n)\n  * clear()  \n* Serializes to disk in the location specified during instantiation\n* Supports the setting of a quota (default 5MB)\n* Events. This doesn't exactly follow the spec which states that events are NOT supposed to be emitted to the browser window\n  that took the action that triggered the event in the first place. They are are only to be emitted to listners in\n  other browser windows. Early browser implementations actually did it this way and we don't really have the equivalent\n  of a browser window in node.js, so we choose to implement them in the current process. We did, however, include the pid\n  information in place of the window uri, so if we later wanted to say think of other node.js processes accessing\n  the same file system, we could actually implement it correctly. That would involve file watchers though and was more\n  than we wanted to implement for now. Maybe later.\n\n### Unsupported ###\n\n* Associative array syntax `localStorage['myKey'] = 'myValue'`\n\n## Credits ##\n\nAuthor: [Larry Maccherone](http://maccherone.com)\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### CoffeeScript ###\n\n    unless localStorage?\n      {LocalStorage} = require('../')  # require('node-localstorage') for you\n      localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch')\n\n    localStorage.setItem('myFirstKey', 'myFirstValue')\n    console.log(localStorage.getItem('myFirstKey'))\n    # myFirstValue\n    \n    localStorage._deleteLocation()  # cleans up ./scratch created during doctest\n\n### JavaScript ###\n\n```JavaScript    \nif (typeof localStorage === \"undefined\" || localStorage === null) {\n  var LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;\n  localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch');\n}\n\nlocalStorage.setItem('myFirstKey', 'myFirstValue');\nconsole.log(localStorage.getItem('myFirstKey'));\n```\n\n## Installation ##\n\n`npm install node-localstorage`\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n* 0.6.0 - 2015-09-11 - Removed references to deprecated fs.existsSync() (thanks, josephbosire)\n* 0.5.2 - 2015-08-01 - Fixed defect where keys were not being updated correctly by removeItem() (thanks, ed69140)\n* 0.5.1 - 2015-06-01 - Added support for events\n* 0.5.0 - 2015-02-02 - Added JSONStorage class which allows you set and get native JSON\n* 0.4.1 - 2015-02-02 - More robust publishing/tagging (like Lumenize)\n* 0.4.0 - 2015-02-02 - Uses more efficient fs.statSync to set initial size (thanks, sudheer594)\n* 0.3.6 - 2014-12-24 - Allows usage without `new`\n* 0.3.5 - 2014-12-23 - Fixed toString() for QuotaExceededError\n* 0.3.4 - 2013-07-07 - Moved CoffeeScript to devDependencies\n* 0.3.3 - 2013-04-05 - Added support for '/' in keys by escaping before creating file names\n* 0.3.2 - 2013-01-19 - Renamed QuotaExceededError to QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR to match most browsers\n* 0.3.1 - 2013-01-19 - Fixed bug where it threw plain old Error instead of new QuotaExceededError\n* 0.3.0 - 2013-01-19 - Added QuotaExceededError support\n* 0.2.0 - 2013-01-03 - Added quota support\n* 0.1.2 - 2012-11-02 - Finally got Travis CI working\n* 0.1.1 - 2012-10-29 - Update to support Travis CI\n* 0.1.0 - 2012-10-29 - Original version\n\n## MIT License ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, 2012, Lawrence S.
